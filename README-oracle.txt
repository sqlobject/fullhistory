This is currently SQLObject 0.6.1 modified to partially support Oracle.
The option to create classes from an existing database is not implemented.
This version has been run against Oracle version 9.2.0.4.0.
Some of the unit tests currently fail or give errors.
The same code tests without errors against mysql.

Unfortunately I did not check this out of subversion originally,
so this directory is simply imported.
