Thanks for looking at SQLObject.  SQLObject is an object-relational
mapper, i.e., a library that will wrap your database tables in Python
classes, and your rows in Python instances.

It absolutely requires Python 2.2 or higher.  It currently supports 
MySQL through the `MySQLdb` package, PostgreSQL through the 
`psycopg` package, SQLite, Firebird, and a DBM-based backend.

For more information please see the documentation in
``docs/SQLObject.html``
