Changes to fix unit tests for 0.6.1 with Oracle support.

test_sqlobject.py:
	Can't have a column called "number", change to "some_number".

	Define create and drop if Oracle in SOStringID

	IndexTest1: don't try to create a second index on the
		same column (gives ORA-01408).
	(*** Just commented out, so not tested for other db's.)

ERROR: testForeignKeyDropTableCascade (__main__.TestCase567)
DatabaseError: ORA-02449: unique/primary keys in table referenced by foreign keys
Add CASCASDE CONTRAINTS to dropTable in oracleconnection.py.

Not fixed:
	ERROR: testPickleCol (__main__.PickleColTest)
	DatabaseError: ORA-01465: invalid hex number
	Need to call createBinary and returnBinary somehow (issue
	of which validator to use.)
